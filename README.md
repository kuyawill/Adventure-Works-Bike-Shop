##Impact of Pricing on Revenue
The average product price is $399.60. Interestingly, a lower average price correlates with higher revenue, as seen in 2020 when the price dropped to $310.50, leading to increased sales. This suggests that the market is price-sensitive, where reducing prices can drive higher demand. From 2018 to 2020, both Canada and the US maintained an average price below $900, making them the top revenue-generating regions. 

##Units Sold and Market Demand
The company sold a total of 274.8k units, with 2020 being the peak year, accounting for 60.81% of all orders. This spike in demand highlights the company’s ability to capitalize on market trends.

##Profit and Margin Performance

##Product Performance and Key Drivers of Revenue
The top revenue-generating products are the Mountain 200 Black, 38, Mountain 200 Black, 42, and Mountain 200 Silver, 38, each contributing between $3.7 million and $4.4 million in revenue. The success of these models suggests a strong brand reputation and alignment with customer preferences.

##Sales Channels and Order Volume
Bikes dominate order volumes, driven primarily by value-added resellers (35k orders), warehouses (33k orders), and specialty bike shops (7k orders).

Australia has a much higher average price of $582.50, yet it does not rank among the top revenue-generating countries. This indicates that simply maintaining higher prices isn’t enough to guarantee higher revenue.
